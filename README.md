# MSE Closure Predictor
## By Nicholas R. Peterson <nrpeterson@gmail.com>

Shows a list of recent questions on Mathematics.StackExchange; for each one, the app provides an estimated probability that the question will be closed due to "lack of context".

This is accomplished by way of a Support Vector Classifier with a linear kernel.  Machine learning methods are completed using [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org), [SciPy](http://scipy.org), and [scikit-learn](http://www.scikit-learn.org/).
