# MSE Closure Predictor
## By Nicholas R. Peterson <nrpeterson@gmail.com>

Shows a list of recent questions on Mathematics.StackExchange; for each one, the app provides an estimated probability that the question will be closed due to "lack of context".

**Note**: This software depends on the [Py-StackExchange](https://github.com/lucjon/Py-StackExchange/wiki) package written by Lucas Jones.
