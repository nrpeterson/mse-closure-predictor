To demonstrate, say $f(x) = x^2$, then from high school, the notation $\\int x^2 dx = \\frac{x^3}{3} + C$ for some constant of integration. But, using the FTC, we also have $\\int_a^x t^2 dt = \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\frac{a^3}{3}$, now since $-\\frac{a^3}{3}$ is a constant, let $C = -\\frac{a^3}{3}$ and we have the same answer.

I got an answer which confused me a Little bit. Unfortunately I didn't get an answer to my further questions. So I try to ask it here in a different question thread. </p>\n\n<p>We have $X_i$ independent distributed according to $Be(p_i)$ and $X=\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$. If $p_i=p_j$ for all $i,j$, then $X$ would have a binomial Distribution. But the $p_i$ could be different. Thus we can say that $X$ has a Poisson-Binomial Distribution $PoissonBin(n,(p_1,...,p_n))$ with expected value $E[X]=\\sum_{i=1}^n p_i$ and variance $Var[X]=\\sum_{i=1}^n p_i (1-p_i)$. We further have that all the $p_i$ are independent and uniformly distributed with $E[p_i]=p$. </p>\n\n<p>According to the answer of kmitov one could make the following calculation:\n$P[X_i=1]=\\int_0^1  P[p_i=x] P[X_i=1 | p_i=x]  dx=\\int_0^1  P[p_i=x]\\cdot  x  ~dx=E[p_i]=p$.</p>\n\n<p>But I find this a little bit confusing although I can understand the steps made in this calculation. This means that if I have a random variable distributed according to $Be(p_i)$ with $E[p_i]=p$ it is the same as to have a random variable distributed according to $Be(p)$? Is there any difference between $X_i$ and $\\tilde{X_i}$ where $\\tilde{X_i}$ has a $Be(p)$ Distribution? If yes, which and why - then my calculation from above would be wrong, wouldn't it? If not, how could that be intuitively?</p>\n\n<p>And if that is true, does it hold that then $X$ and $\\tilde{X}:=\\sum_{i=1}^n \\tilde{X_i}$ (thus $\\tilde{X}$ has a $Bin(n,p)$ Distribution) are the same, and thus $X$ is distributed according to $Bin(n,p)$?</p>\n\n<p>But then, the Poisson Binomial Distribution is only then needed if the $p_i$ are not identically distributed?</p>\n\n<p>Is it further important, that the $p_i$ are independent? Or would this work in any case? Which conditions are needed, such that $X$ has indeed a Binomial $Bin(n,p)$ Distribution?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you very much for your help, I'm a Little bit confused now..

So I do it on this data to get a vector representation although its infinite dimensional, mathematically, I do it in alogorithmic approximation to get a finite dimensional vector representation, for each data element. In practicality this isometric embedding on real data is an approximate one. (I do it via clustering the data with defined metric).

This is the third time I've hosted this type of tournament. The first two times, we had 28 and 36 people play 7 rounds and I could not figure out a schedule that allowed for everyone to play with another play a maximum of one time. This time, we had 80 people play 8 rounds and I had no issue guaranteeing that everyone person was scheduled against others a maximum of one time. I'm considering altering the format for our next tournament and I want to know if there is a formula or algorithm that can be used to either:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Determine the maximum number of rounds (r) that can be scheduled to guarantee each person is only scheduled to play with another person a maximum of one time throughout the tournament, given p number of participants.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>OR</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Determine the minimum number of participants (p) that are needed to guarantee that each will be scheduled against another participant a maximum of one time, given r number of rounds.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The format of the tournament is: for each round, I schedule 4 people to a group. They play 3 games, one with each other group member as their partner. So, each participant plays against 3 other people in each round. Points are reported to me and the sum of points/wins is totaled to determine a ranking. There is no elimination. You can assume that the number of participants is a multiple of 4.</p>\n\n<p>The way that I've scheduled this, up to this point, is to put the names in a column in a spreadsheet and use a formula that based on the table number (t:1-20), seat number (s:1-4), a seed number for the round (r:1,4,5,7,9,11,13,17), and number of participants (p) that would pick a person from the list and put them into that seat. The basic formula is something along the lines of</p>\n\n<p>i = ((((t - 1) * 4) + (s - 1)) * r + 1) % p</p>\n\n<p>It also accounts for if p is divisible by r by adding 1 each loop through the list. I'm not sure if this is necessarily the most efficient way to schedule, but I doubt that it is.

In probability, the concept of convolution makes perfect sense to me. If $t$ is a random variable with density $g(t)$ and $g(t) = f(x)h(y)$, then $P(T = t) = \\int f(\\tau)h(t-\\tau) d \\tau$. This is because the integral represents all the various ways that $x$ and $y$ can add to become the value $t$. A similar argument holds for the discrete case.</p>\n\n<p>But when I'm reading the various \"intros to signals and systems texts\", they describe a step by step process where you flip the h function over the y-axis, so that its  $h(-\\tau)$, add t, and then keep moving it over to the right step by step and calculating the area ( i.e.: the value of the integral at each time $\\tau$ )  by calculating the area covered by the overlapped values of $f$ and $h$. This doesn't make sense to me. In other words, is there some analog in signals and systems to the \"various ways that $x$ and $y$ can add to become the value $t$ in probability . Clearly, in the signals and systems framework, $t$ is not a random variable so the interpretation has to be totally different. But I'm wondering if there is some way of REALLY understanding why this is done. Maybe there is some physical reason due to what the function $h$ actually represents. They keep referring to it as the impulse response function so maybe my lack of understanding is because  I'm not understanding what the impulse response function really represents ?

This is simply connected iff $n &gt; 2$, since it deformation retracts to $S^{n-1}$. If instead we consider $\\mathbb{R}^n - L$ where $L$ is a line, we can factor it as $\\mathbb{R}\\times(\\mathbb{R}^{n-1} - \\{0\\})$, so this is simply connected iff $n &gt; 3$, using the previous result. With induction it is obtained that $\\mathbb{R}^n - V$ where $V$ is a linear subspace is simply connected iff $\\dim V &lt; n -2$.</p>\n\n<p>It easy easy to generalize at least the case with lines. If we from $\\mathbb R^n$ remove $k$ lines through the origin, the space deformation retracts to $S^{n-1} - C$ where $C$ is a set of $2k$ points, by stereographic projection from any of those points we get a homeomorphism to $\\mathbb{R}^{n-1} - C'$, which is simply connected iff $n &gt; 3$. One would conjecture that removing $k$ distinct $r$-planes from $\\mathbb R^n$ would result in a simply connected space for $n &gt; r + 2$, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>I was not able to come up with a simple proof for this other than for $k = 2$ (deformation retract to $S^{n-1}$ with 2 distinct great circles removed, they must intersect in a point, project stereographically from that point, we get $\\mathbb R^{n-1}$ with 2 lines removed.)</p>\n\n<p>In fact a vastly more general result is true: <strong>If $M$ is an $n$-dimensional smooth manifold and $X$ is a union of finitely many embedded submanifolds of $M$, all with codimension at least $k$, $\\pi_i(M) \\cong \\pi_i(M - X)$ for $i &lt; k-1$</strong>. The proof is fairly straightforward but somewhat of a sledgehammer:</p>\n\n<p>Taking homotopy groups is a functor, so consider the inclusion map $\\iota : M - X \\to X$ and $\\iota^*_i = \\pi_i(\\iota)$. If $f$ is a map $S^i \\to M$, then $f$ is homotopic to $\\tilde{f}$ which is transverse to $X$. If $i + (n-k) &lt; n$, this means that $X$ and the image of $\\tilde f$ are disjoint, so $[f] = [\\tilde f]$ is in the image of $\\iota^*_i$, so it is surjective. If $[f] = 1$, there is a map $g : D^{i+1} \\to M$ such that $g|_{\\partial D^{i+1}}= f$. But then if $i+1 + (n-k) &lt; n$, we have that $g$ is homotopic to $\\tilde g$ the image of which is disjoint from $X$. So if $\\iota^*_i$ maps a homotopy class to something null-homotopic in $M$, that homotopy class is actually null-homotopic in $M-X$, that is, the kernel of $\\iota^*_i$ is trivial, and we are done.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So my question is</strong>: is there a name for this result, which I imagine is well known, and is there a textbook reference for it?
