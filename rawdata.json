The sequence $s_1, s_2,...$ corresponds to a sequence of such quadruples. Since all shapes in the sequence are contained in $c$, the sequence of quadruples is bounded, and hence it has an accumulation point, $(x_a,y_a,x_b,y_b)$. This accumulation point represents a square, $s$. Now this accumulation point satisfies:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>$s\\subseteq c$. Otherwise, since $c$ is closed, $s$ intersects the exterior of $c$, and hence there must be an infinite number of $s_i$ (for sufficiently large $i$) that also intersect the exterior of $c$ - a contradiction.</li>\n<li>The distances from $s$ to $P$ is 0.

If $p_i=p_j$ for all $i,j$, then $X$ would have a binomial Distribution. But the $p_i$ could be different. Thus we can say that $X$ has a Poisson-Binomial Distribution $PoissonBin(n,(p_1,...,p_n))$ with expected value $E[X]=\\sum_{i=1}^n p_i$ and variance $Var[X]=\\sum_{i=1}^n p_i (1-p_i)$.

This means that if I have a random variable distributed according to $Be(p_i)$ with $E[p_i]=p$ it is the same as to have a random variable distributed according to $Be(p)$? Is there any difference between $X_i$ and $\\tilde{X_i}$ where $\\tilde{X_i}$ has a $Be(p)$ Distribution? If yes, which and why - then my calculation from above would be wrong, wouldn't it? If not, how could that be intuitively?</p>\n\n<p>And if that is true, does it hold that then $X$ and $\\tilde{X}:=\\sum_{i=1}^n \\tilde{X_i}$ (thus $\\tilde{X}$ has a $Bin(n,p)$ Distribution) are the same, and thus $X$ is distributed according to $Bin(n,p)$?</p>\n\n<p>But then, the Poisson Binomial Distribution is only then needed if the $p_i$ are not identically distributed?</p>\n\n<p>Is it further important, that the $p_i$ are independent?

This time, we had 80 people play 8 rounds and I had no issue guaranteeing that everyone person was scheduled against others a maximum of one time. I'm considering altering the format for our next tournament and I want to know if there is a formula or algorithm that can be used to either:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Determine the maximum number of rounds (r) that can be scheduled to guarantee each person is only scheduled to play with another person a maximum of one time throughout the tournament, given p number of participants.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>OR</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Determine the minimum number of participants (p) that are needed to guarantee that each will be scheduled against another participant a maximum of one time, given r number of rounds.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The format of the tournament is: for each round, I schedule 4 people to a group. They play 3 games, one with each other group member as their partner. So, each participant plays against 3 other people in each round. Points are reported to me and the sum of points/wins is totaled to determine a ranking. There is no elimination. You can assume that the number of participants is a multiple of 4.</p>\n\n<p>The way that I've scheduled this, up to this point, is to put the names in a column in a spreadsheet and use a formula that based on the table number (t:1-20), seat number (s:1-4), a seed number for the round (r:1,4,5,7,9,11,13,17), and number of participants (p) that would pick a person from the list and put them into that seat.

I just don't get why you do the flip over the y-axis thing and then move it slowly to the right step by step and keep figuring out the overlapped areas. </p>\n\n<p>My take is that it's really essential to understand convolution in signals and systems or else you cannot go an further. So I stopped and decided to ask here because every book seems to give the same step by step overlap explanation and I'm continuously stumped by it. I realize it's a lot to ask for an explanation but maybe someone knows of a text that explains the WHY part of the process or possibly relates it to the convolution in probability.

The proof is fairly straightforward but somewhat of a sledgehammer:</p>\n\n<p>Taking homotopy groups is a functor, so consider the inclusion map $\\iota : M - X \\to X$ and $\\iota^*_i = \\pi_i(\\iota)$. If $f$ is a map $S^i \\to M$, then $f$ is homotopic to $\\tilde{f}$ which is transverse to $X$. If $i + (n-k) &lt; n$, this means that $X$ and the image of $\\tilde f$ are disjoint, so $[f] = [\\tilde f]$ is in the image of $\\iota^*_i$, so it is surjective. If $[f] = 1$, there is a map $g : D^{i+1} \\to M$ such that $g|_{\\partial D^{i+1}}= f$. But then if $i+1 + (n-k) &lt; n$, we have that $g$ is homotopic to $\\tilde g$ the image of which is disjoint from $X$. So if $\\iota^*_i$ maps a homotopy class to something null-homotopic in $M$, that homotopy class is actually null-homotopic in $M-X$, that is, the kernel of $\\iota^*_i$ is trivial, and we are done.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So my question is</strong>: is there a name for this result, which I imagine is well known, and is there a textbook reference for it?

A snapshot of our Simulink model can be seen <a href=\"http://imgur.com/cSx34s2\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, we are investigating a closed-loop feedback approach, and we have found that our system is tending towards zero whenever given a constant input. The function we wish to mirror is a simple step function, with a step size of 1. However, we find that our system error always tends toward one instead of zero, and it does not follow the input trajectory at all.</p>\n\n<p>We have considered pole-cancelling and PID controllers, and have been unsuccessful so far.

My ideal answer would show me how to fill in the needed steps in this algebraic situation, but I would also be interested to hear more geometric arguments as well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Algebraic reformulation:</strong> Let $g$ be an irreducible polynomial in $k[x_1,\\dots,x_r]$. Let $L_1,\\dots,L_{r-1}$ be $r-1$ linear functions on $\\mathbb{A}^r$, and let each $L_j = \\ell_j +\\alpha_j$ where each $\\ell_j$ is a linear form and each $\\alpha_j\\in k$. Suppose the $\\ell_j$'s are linearly independent. Let $g_m$ be $g$'s maximum-degree homogeneous component, and suppose we are given that $g_m$ vanishes on the common zero set of $\\ell_1,\\dots,\\ell_{r-1}$. Prove that in this case, $k[x_1,\\dots,x_r]/(g)$ is not finite over the subring generated by the $L_j$'s.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Explanation of algebraic reformulation:</strong> The $L_j$'s are the restrictions to $\\mathbb{A}^r$ of linear forms $L_j'$ on $\\mathbb{P}^r$ that, together with $x_0=0$, cut out the point $p$ that is the center of the stereographic projection. Then the projection is, for suitable parametrization of the hyperplane being projected into, given by $(x_0:x_1:\\dots:x_r)\\mapsto (x_0:L_1':\\dots:L_{r-1}')$; so its restriction to $\\mathbb{A}^r$ is given by $(x_1,\\dots,x_r)\\mapsto (L_1,\\dots,L_{r-1})$. The fact that $p$ is in $X$'s projective closure is expressed by the condition that when $x_0=0$ and all the $L_j'$'s are zero too, then $g$'s homogenization is zero. This translates into the condition that $g_m$ vanishes when all the $\\ell_j$'s vanish. The question of whether the map is finite is then the question of whether $X$'s coordinate ring $k[x_1,\\dots,x_r]/(g)$ is finite over the pullback image of $k[y_1,\\dots,y_{r-1}]$ (the coordinate ring of the hyperplane), which is the subalgebra generated by the $L_j$'s.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Work so far:</strong> By the Nullstellensatz, the condition that $g_m$ vanishes when the $\\ell_j$'s vanish amounts to saying that $g_m$ is in the radical of the ideal generated by the $\\ell_j$'s; call it $L$. It seems to me that this ideal is already radical, since the $\\ell_j$'s are homogeneous of degree $1$, though I'm not sure of this. Then $g_m$ is actually in $L$. Also, not every $x_i$ can be in $L$ because since it is a homogeneous ideal, an $x_i$ could only be in $L$ if it is a linear combination of the $\\ell_j$'s, but there are only $r-1$ of them and $r$ $x_i$'s, so they cannot span the $k$-vector space containing the $x_i$'s. So, consider an $x_i$ that is not in $L$. If $k[X]$ were finite over the subalgebra generated by the $L$'s, there would be an integral equation for $x_i$ over this subalgebra, occurring in $k[X] = k[x_1,\\dots,x_r]/(g)$:</p>\n\n<p>$$x_i^s + \\sum_{j=0}^{s-1} F_j(L_1,\\dots,L_{r-1}) x_i^j = 0$$</p>\n\n<p>Lifting this to an equation in $k[x_1,\\dots,x_r]$, and noting that polynomials in the $L_j$'s are equally well polynomials in the $\\ell_j$'s (and changing the $F_j$'s accordingly), yields:</p>\n\n<p>$$x_i^s + \\sum_{j=0}^{s-1} F_j(\\ell_1,\\dots,\\ell_{r-1}) x_i^j = Hg$$</p>\n\n<p>for some $H\\in k[x_1,\\dots,x_r]$.</p>\n\n<p>If I could rig the left side to guarantee that the highest-degree homogeneous component is degree $s$, then this would yield a contradiction: reducing mod $L$ would reduce the degree of the right side but not the left, since $x_i^s\\notin L$ (if I am right that $L$ is radical). But this is where I am stuck.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance for your thoughts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Addendum, 3/27:</strong> It seems that the result is false! user119882 gives more or less the easiest possible counterexample: $r=2$, $L_1=x$, $g=y+x^2$.
