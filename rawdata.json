One gets a composition morphism $$\\mu:\\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(B,C) \\otimes \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,B) \\rightarrow \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,C)$$\nby requiring it to be adjoint to the morphism $$\\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(B,C) \\otimes ( \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,B) \\otimes A)   \\xrightarrow{1 \\otimes ev^A_B} \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(B,C) \\otimes B \\xrightarrow{ev^B_C} C$$  where the evaluation morphisms are the adjoints to the identity $\\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,B) \\rightarrow \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,B)$. Now, I want to show that this composition operation is associative. I considered the first thing I could think of, using adjointness. So I wrote up a diagram:</p>\n\n<p>$$\\require{AMScd} \\begin{CD} \\mathcal{V}(\\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(C,D) \\otimes \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(B,C) \\otimes \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,B),\\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,D)) @&lt;(1 \\otimes \\mu)^\\ast&lt;&lt; \\mathcal{V}(\\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(C,D)\\otimes \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,C),\\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,D)) \\\\\n @VVV @VVV \\\\ \n\\mathcal{V}(\\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(C,D) \\otimes \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(B,C) \\otimes \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,B) \\otimes A , D) @&lt;(1\\otimes\\mu \\otimes 1 )^\\ast &lt;&lt; \\mathcal{V}(\\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(C,D)\\otimes \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,C) \\otimes A,D)\\end{CD}$$</p>\n\n<p>where the vertical arrows are isos and got that the morphism $\\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(C,D) \\otimes ( \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(B,C)\\otimes \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,B) ) \\xrightarrow{1 \\otimes \\mu} \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(C,D) \\otimes \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,C) \\xrightarrow{\\mu} \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,D)$ is adjoint to the morphism\n$(ev^C_D(1 \\otimes ev^A_C))(1 \\otimes \\mu \\otimes 1).$ In the same way, I write up a diagram of the following form to see what \n $( \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(C,D) \\otimes  \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(B,C) )\\otimes \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,B)  \\xrightarrow{\\mu \\otimes 1} \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(B,D) \\otimes \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,B) \\xrightarrow{\\mu} \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,D)$ is adjoint to. The diagram is</p>\n\n<p>$$\\require{AMScd} \\begin{CD} \\mathcal{V}(\\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(C,D) \\otimes \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(B,C) \\otimes \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,B),\\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,D)) @&lt;(\\mu \\otimes 1)^\\ast&lt;&lt; \\mathcal{V}(\\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(B,D)\\otimes \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,B),\\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,D)) \\\\\n @VVV @VVV \\\\ \n\\mathcal{V}(\\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(C,D) \\otimes \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(B,C) \\otimes \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,B) \\otimes A , D) @&lt;(\\mu \\otimes 1 \\otimes 1 )^\\ast &lt;&lt; \\mathcal{V}(\\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(B,D)\\otimes \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,B) \\otimes A,D)\\end{CD}$$\nso that the above composition is adjoint to $(ev^B_D(1 \\otimes ev^B_A))(\\mu \\otimes 1 \\otimes 1)$. So what we now want to show is that, actually:\n$$(ev^B_D(1 \\otimes ev^B_A))(\\mu \\otimes 1 \\otimes 1) = (ev^C_D(1 \\otimes ev^A_C))(1 \\otimes \\mu \\otimes 1).$$</p>\n\n<p>I am a bit unsure how to prove this to be honest - should I use some unit-counit to reduce it further?

I've been told that by writing a modular relation $P(f)/f = j$ where $P$ is a polynomial and $j$ the $j$-function, such points correspond to $j=0$ or $1728$ and the map $P(f)/f$ being unramified.</p>\n\n<p>I'm happy with $f_2=-2^{-6}$ corresponding to $j=1728$ once one writes $(1+256f_2)^3/f_2 = j$, but how do I check if the map above is unramified?</p>\n\n<p>In the $p=5$ case, <a href=\"http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~fcale/papers/Beukers.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">this paper</a> seems to suggest that $f_5$ takes the value of $\\pm 5^{-3/2}$ at an elliptic point of $X_0(5)$ (equation 3.19, comparing with the various inequalities from section 3.1), but I can't seem to use the modular relation at all if this is the case. I get</p>\n\n<p>$$\\frac{(1+250f_5+3125f_5^2)^3}{f_5} = j$$</p>\n\n<p>but then $f_5=\\pm5^{-3/2}$ doesn't correspond at all to $j=0$ or $1728$, and indeed such values of $f$ are rather horrible... If anyone could shed any light on finding these points and the values of $f$ at them, it would be much appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I've since discovered that the map is ramified at a point if and only if its derivative vanishes there. Using this, it's easy to determine that $-2^{-6}$ is the only $f_2$ value which gives $P(f_2)/f_2 = 0$ or $1728$ with non-vanishing derivative.</p>\n\n<p>As for $p=5$, the only values of $f_5$ for which $(1+250f_5+3125f_5^2)^3/f_f = 0$ or $1728$ and the derivative is nonzero are $f_5 = 5^{-3}(-11\\pm 2i)$, which has norm $5^{-3/2}$, as (sort of) conjectured.</p>\n", "creation_date": 1396180823, "tags": ["algebraic-curves", "modular-forms"], "question_id": 732397, "title": "Elliptic points on modular curves and a uniformising parameter", "owner": {"reputation": 1239}}, {"body": "<p>I am reading Goldschmidt's Algebraic functions and projective curves.

I got an answer which confused me a Little bit. Unfortunately I didn't get an answer to my further questions.

If $p_i=p_j$ for all $i,j$, then $X$ would have a binomial Distribution. But the $p_i$ could be different. Thus we can say that $X$ has a Poisson-Binomial Distribution $PoissonBin(n,(p_1,...,p_n))$ with expected value $E[X]=\\sum_{i=1}^n p_i$ and variance $Var[X]=\\sum_{i=1}^n p_i (1-p_i)$. We further have that all the $p_i$ are independent and uniformly distributed with $E[p_i]=p$. </p>\n\n<p>According to the answer of kmitov one could make the following calculation:\n$P[X_i=1]=\\int_0^1  P[p_i=x] P[X_i=1 | p_i=x]  dx=\\int_0^1  P[p_i=x]\\cdot  x  ~dx=E[p_i]=p$.</p>\n\n<p>But I find this a little bit confusing although I can understand the steps made in this calculation. This means that if I have a random variable distributed according to $Be(p_i)$ with $E[p_i]=p$ it is the same as to have a random variable distributed according to $Be(p)$? Is there any difference between $X_i$ and $\\tilde{X_i}$ where $\\tilde{X_i}$ has a $Be(p)$ Distribution? If yes, which and why - then my calculation from above would be wrong, wouldn't it? If not, how could that be intuitively?</p>\n\n<p>And if that is true, does it hold that then $X$ and $\\tilde{X}:=\\sum_{i=1}^n \\tilde{X_i}$ (thus $\\tilde{X}$ has a $Bin(n,p)$ Distribution) are the same, and thus $X$ is distributed according to $Bin(n,p)$?</p>\n\n<p>But then, the Poisson Binomial Distribution is only then needed if the $p_i$ are not identically distributed?</p>\n\n<p>Is it further important, that the $p_i$ are independent? Or would this work in any case? Which conditions are needed, such that $X$ has indeed a Binomial $Bin(n,p)$ Distribution?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you very much for your help, I'm a Little bit confused now..

This is the third time I've hosted this type of tournament. The first two times, we had 28 and 36 people play 7 rounds and I could not figure out a schedule that allowed for everyone to play with another play a maximum of one time. This time, we had 80 people play 8 rounds and I had no issue guaranteeing that everyone person was scheduled against others a maximum of one time. I'm considering altering the format for our next tournament and I want to know if there is a formula or algorithm that can be used to either:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Determine the maximum number of rounds (r) that can be scheduled to guarantee each person is only scheduled to play with another person a maximum of one time throughout the tournament, given p number of participants.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>OR</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Determine the minimum number of participants (p) that are needed to guarantee that each will be scheduled against another participant a maximum of one time, given r number of rounds.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The format of the tournament is: for each round, I schedule 4 people to a group. They play 3 games, one with each other group member as their partner. So, each participant plays against 3 other people in each round. Points are reported to me and the sum of points/wins is totaled to determine a ranking. There is no elimination. You can assume that the number of participants is a multiple of 4.</p>\n\n<p>The way that I've scheduled this, up to this point, is to put the names in a column in a spreadsheet and use a formula that based on the table number (t:1-20), seat number (s:1-4), a seed number for the round (r:1,4,5,7,9,11,13,17), and number of participants (p) that would pick a person from the list and put them into that seat. The basic formula is something along the lines of</p>\n\n<p>i = ((((t - 1) * 4) + (s - 1)) * r + 1) % p</p>\n\n<p>It also accounts for if p is divisible by r by adding 1 each loop through the list. I'm not sure if this is necessarily the most efficient way to schedule, but I doubt that it is.
