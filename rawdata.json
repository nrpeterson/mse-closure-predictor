I personally believe that the importance of math is due to its usefulness and lots of applications. Mathematics is used in everywhere nowadays; as Ian Stewart said in his book <em>Letters to a young mathematicians</em>, if we put 'MATH IN IT' stickers on everything that used math, then it will be hard to find a thing without the sticker. In this point of view, math is important because of its useful results. </p>\n\n<p>However, some of the most sophisticated results of math, such as Fermat's last theorem, is not that useful or applicable in other fields. Despite their seemingly unusefulness, I think these results are also important because they have extended the boundaries of human knowledge. Knowing is important because it gives us some answers about who we are and how the universe is like. In the ancient times, people thought that the earth is flat and is the center of the whole universe. But now we know that the earth is round, and we are probably not the major characters in the history of universe. In this sense, mathematics is important because it gives us truths. </p>\n\n<p>Now let me give you my personal anecdote. I was occasionally talking about the proof assistant <em>Coq</em> to my analysis professor. Of course <em>Coq</em> cannot prove everything, but she asked me whether I want all the problems in math to be solved by computers, supposing the proofs of computers are just like those of human mathematicians that no one can distinguish the proofs by computers from those of humans. I said yes, since I thought whether it is done by computers or humans, knowing the truth is important. But my professor said she don't like it. She thinks proofs made by computers are not as beautiful as those of humans. She thinks the importance of mathematics is in the joy of solving problems, and the beauty of mathematics comes from the efforts put in when solving problems. In this point of view, unknown mathematical truths are something like undisturbed nature that we have to prevent computers from pervading mathematical world. </p>\n\n<p>Now I am confused. Where does the importance of math come from? Is using computers to prove theorems damage the very nature of mathematics?</p>\n", "question_id": 750334, "creation_date": 1397272087, "closed_date": 1397278341, "tags": ["philosophy"], "title": "Where does the importance of math come from?"}, {"owner": {"reputation": 7}, "closed_details": {"description": "There are either too many possible answers, or good answers would be too long for this format.

Giving a more concrete example if we take $e^2.42$ then this is more or less $1 + 2.42 + (1/2)(2.42)^2 + (1/6)(2.42)^3 + (1/24)(2.42)^4$ and the error between the approximation and the actual value is no larger than $2.42^5$.</p>\n\n<p>The question is <strong>how do we know this</strong>?</p>\n\n<p>Certainly $x^5$ bounds, as $x$ goes to $0$, each term individually ($Cx^n=O(x^5)$ as $x\\rightarrow 0$ as long as $n&gt;5$, $C$ constant) but how do we prove the <strong>sum</strong> of all the individual terms is bounded? We have to show that:</p>\n\n<p>$$\nO(x^5)=\\frac{x^6}{6!}+\\frac{x^7}{7!}+\\frac{x^8}{8!}+\\frac{x^9}{9!}+\\frac{x^{10}}{10!}+\\frac{x^{11}}{11!}+...),x\\rightarrow 0\n$$</p>\n\n<p>Falling back on the previous example, maybe the infinite sum will actually be slightly larger than $2.42^5$.

Here are two examples of what I mean by that. (1) In Euclid, the first 28 propositions are those that never invoke the parallel postulate. The later theorems were considered to have a less solid status because the parallel postulate was felt to be less solid than the others. (2) Theorems that depend on the full axiom of choice (as opposed to some weaker axiom such as countable choice, CC) are generally felt to have a different status than those that don't.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of applications, I think that for example any result that holds with AC but fails with CC cannot possibly have any physical interpretation, since measurement is a finite process with finite precision. For such an application, AC is at best a convenience, and may just be false as a description of that application, e.g., we don't expect the Banach-Tarski paradox to be meaningful as a description of any real physical process of dissection and reassembly.</p>\n\n<p>The Riemann rearrangement theorem tells us that for conditionally convergent series, convergence doesn't really mean what we would like it to mean. Is it valid as a matter of interpretation to say that this severely limits the possible practical interest of any conditionally convergent series? Suppose, for example, that we're using an infinite series to find an electrostatic energy in an infinite crystal lattice. If the series is only conditionally convergent, then we have a problem. Nature clearly doesn't \"know\" in what order to add the terms, and therefore the sum seems unlikely to have physical significance. Maybe in this example what would be happening would be that the sum for a finite lattice would be very different from that for an infinite lattice, with the discrepancy depending strongly on the exact size and shape.</p>\n\n<p>My analogy between the Riemann rearrangement theorem and the parallel postulate and AC is clearly inexact because the issue is picking an appropriate definition (of convergence) rather than picking an appropriate set of axioms. But the analogy does seem to work because it raises the question of whether some results have different status from others.</p>\n", "question_id": 741107, "creation_date": 1396720166, "closed_date": 1396749169, "tags": ["sequences-and-series", "analysis", "physics", "philosophy"], "title": "Interpretation of Riemann rearrangement theorem"}, {"owner": {"reputation": 11}, "closed_details": {"description": "This question appears to be off-topic.

Also, choice function quantification can do what individual quantification can do (perhaps even in a better way, since, e.g., conservativity [they are referring to the purported universal about quantifiers in natural language: that for any quantifier phrase Qp and predicate R, \"Qp Rs\" is semantically equivalent to \"Qp are p that R\". That is \"Every boy sings\" is equivalent to \"Every boy is a boy that sings\", and so on for other quantifiers) falls out as a theorem in the former but not in the latter; see Abels &amp; Mart\u00ed, 2010 for the proof), and it can also do more, so it is possible that there is no individual quantification at all in natural languages (at least, that natural language quantified determiners do not quantify over individuals).\"</p>\n\n<p>The sort of quantification that they are referring to is that provided by what syntacticians understand as quantifier phrases (Every boy, some boy, most boys, etc), since we might say that natural language sometimes is committed to quantification over entities other than choice functions, but this would be besides their point. For them, quantified determiners (\"every\", \"some\", \"most\", etc) in natural language are quantifiers over choice functions (see their entry for the quantificational determiner \"no\" on page 22, which treats \"no\" as a function of type   &lt;&lt; et, e>, t>, t>, where the quantificational determiner (\"no\") is a choice function of type<br>\n&lt; et,e> (i.e the choice function takes a set ( represented as a characteristic function of type &lt; et>), and returns an individual &lt; e > in that set.)\n   My question to those who know more about choice functions is this: If all quantificational determiners were choice functions, would any set-theoretic paradox or other type of problem ensue?</p>\n", "question_id": 733697, "creation_date": 1396262067, "closed_date": 1396677719, "tags": ["logic"], "title": "Choice functions"}, {"owner": {"reputation": 3681}, "closed_details": {"description": "This question has been asked before and already has an answer.

Here is an example.</p>\n\n<p>If we define a set $\\{f|(\\exists x_1 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ (set of integers)) $\\wedge$ ($\\exists x_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z^+}$ (set of positive integers)) $\\wedge$ $ (f=x_1.\\sqrt{x_2})\\}$, then the members of the set can be obtained by writing the $x_1$'s and $x_2$'s along the vertical and the horizontal direction as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>   1   2   3   4 \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>1  $\\ \\sqrt{1}$, $\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3}$, $\\sqrt{4}$...</p>\n\n<p>2 $\\ 2\\sqrt{1}$, 2$\\sqrt{2}$, 2$\\sqrt{3}$, 2$\\sqrt{4}$...</p>\n\n<p>3 $\\ 3\\sqrt{1}$, 3$\\sqrt{2}$, 3$\\sqrt{3}$, 3$\\sqrt{4}$...</p>\n\n<p>4 $\\ 4\\sqrt{1}$, 4$\\sqrt{2}$, 4$\\sqrt{3}$, 4$\\sqrt{4}$...\n.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the above set consists of all the integers along with some irrational numbers. There are two possible arguments here:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Argument 1</strong>: If, we map all the integers to the set of integers then there are still remaining irrational numbers which are not mapped to any elements in the set of the integers. Using this argument, can we state that the above mentioned set has a cardinality that is at least greater than that of the set of integers? This argument as it seems might not be mathematically sound.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Argument 2</strong>: If we traverse the set (skipping any repeated elements) to show a one-to-one correspondence with the set of integers, can we say that this set also has the same cardinality as that of the set of integers. Does, this imply that any set that can be expressed exhaustively using integers (finite in number) has the cardinality same as that of the set of integers? Does this also hold for sets that can be expressed using countably infinite integers?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: The original argument of George Cantor regarding the cardinality of rational numbers can be obtained by defining a similar set of two variables $\\{f|(\\exists x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ (set of integers)) $\\wedge$ $ (f\\neq 0 \\wedge  f.x_2=x_1)\\}$. He also showed that the cardinality of the set of rational numbers is same as that of natural numbers using a similar approach.</p>\n\n<p>The above mentioned argument can be extended to sets constructed using more variables with increasingly complex expressions as follows:</p>\n\n<p>$\\{f|(\\exists x_1,x_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$) $\\wedge$ ($\\exists x_3 \\in \\mathbb{Z^+}$) $\\wedge$ $ (f=x_1.e^{x_2}\\sqrt{x_3})\\}$</p>\n\n<p>$\\{f|(\\exists x_1,x_2,x_3 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$) $\\wedge$ ($\\exists x_4 \\in \\mathbb{Z^+}$) $\\wedge$ $ (f=x_1.\\pi^{x_2}.e^{x_3}\\sqrt{x_4})\\}$</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>$\\{f|(\\exists x_1,x_2,x_3,...,x_{\\infty} \\in \\mathbb{Z}$) $\\wedge$ $ (f=\\phi(x_1,x_2,...,x_{\\infty}))=\\mathbb{R}\\}$ (set of real numbers expressed with an infinitely complex function $\\phi(x_1,x_2,...,x_{\\infty})$)</p>\n\n<p>Is it possible to say that the set of real numbers can be obtained by a function of infinite complexity expressed using finite or countably infinite number of variables?

The RNG produces the winning entry number entirely at random from the range of selections issued, so each individual $1 Million Guaranteed Prize Draw selection has an equal chance of winning the prize.  </p>\n\n<p>Please note, a \"seed number\" is selected for each draw through a multi-stage process which is independently witnessed and ensures randomness in the selection of the seed number.</p>\n\n<p>On a national level, an RNG is used for the MAXMILLIONS draws.  The RNG draws winning numbers from the range of all possible numbers.</p>\n\n<p>The RNG system was designed to be as unpredictable as a ball-drop draw.  Considerable safeguards, as well as verification by external auditors, are in place for all lottery draws \u2013 regardless of how the results are generated. In terms of RNG, like the ball machine, the actual machines for RNG are kept inside a safe in a controlled room.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the LOTTO MAX odds of winning, the odds of matching 7 of 7 winning numbers for a single line are 1 in 85,900,584.   However, since LOTTO MAX is designed to give players three lines per $5 played, the odds of a ticket winning a LOTTO MAX jackpot are approximately 1 in 28,633,528 (1 in 85,900,584 divided by 3).  In all our advertising for LOTTO MAX, the wording \u201cOdds of Winning Per $5 Play\u201d is used.  Since players receive three lines per $5 played, these odds reflect all three sets of numbers generated.   </p>\n", "question_id": 728341, "creation_date": 1395876202, "closed_date": 1395882297, "tags": ["factorial", "combinations"], "title": "Lottery Canada Statistics Lie?!?!"}, {"owner": {"reputation": 42}, "closed_details": {"description": "This question has been asked before and already has an answer.

Thus, any theory in first order logic should have more models (many of them unintended, or non-standard)  than the same theory in second order logic. \nIn first order logic, within ZF, the axiom of choice is equivalent to the well-ordering principle.

I just want to know how to maximize my chances of attaining this goal.</p>\n\n<p>Some careers for highly educated math people with high earnings potential:</p>\n\n<p>-Finance</p>\n\n<p>-Actuary</p>\n\n<p>-Data Science</p>\n\n<p>-Software</p>\n\n<p>-Consulting</p>\n\n<p>However, I've realized that out of these, only data science, finance, and consulting would even care about a PhD in applied math vs. a master's, and even in those it's possible for just a MS to get a job. <strong>Should I forget about the PhD?</strong> I don't want to spend more than 4-5 years on it, and though I love applied math, I know a career in academia is not what I want.</p>\n\n<p>Next, <strong>are there other fields for applied mathematics/CS people with a high earnings potential</strong>?</p>\n\n<p>Finally, <strong>which field should I pick to maximize my likelihood of attaining an eventual $500k salary relatively quickly</strong>? (Again, I realize that this likelihood is still very small.)</p>\n\n<p>Things that I believe mean that my plan has at least a nonzero chance of success: </p>\n\n<p>-Strong coding skills, lots of CS experience including internships</p>\n\n<p>-Top undergraduate univ, top graduate univ [if I don't get into top PhD programs I will just do a master's at a top school, as master's programs are easier to get into and I have basically a guarantee of getting into the master's program at my current school if nothing else]</p>\n\n<p>-Strong communication skills</p>\n\n<p>-Drive and willingness to adapt (sounds stupid, but is still true)</p>\n", "question_id": 716362, "creation_date": 1395113495, "closed_date": 1395128759, "tags": ["soft-question", "applications", "career-development"], "title": "Soft question: Lucrative careers for applied mathematics"}, {"owner": {"reputation": 18}, "closed_details": {"description": "This question has been asked before and already has an answer.

To place this question let me define with what I mean with 3 dimensions in the following.</p>\n\n<p>When we first explore the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number\" rel=\"nofollow\">complex numbers</a> we start by looking at roots of negative numbers where we define (in order to solve equations with negative roots):$$i=\\sqrt{-1}.$$\nUsing this imaginary unit we can define a complex number as $$z=a+ib,\\text{ with } z_1z_2=(a_1a_2-b_1b_2)+i(a_1b_2+a_2b_1),$$ or written as a 2-tupel:$$z=(a,b),\\text{ with } z_1z_2=(a_1a_2-b_1b_2,a_1b_2+a_2b_1).$$The complex number has one real variable and one imaginary variable, so it can be represented as in a 2-dimensional plane.</p>\n\n<p>If we make it more complex (no pun intended), we arrive at the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion\" rel=\"nofollow\">quaternions</a>, which are an extention of the complex numbers, here we have 3 imaginary units $i$, $j$ and $k$ with the property:\n$$i^2=j^2=k^2=ijk=-1.$$This number can be represented in a 4-dimensional space (so I say it has 4 dimensions).</p>\n\n<p>Now I was wondering if there might exist some kind of complex number with only 2 imaginary units $i$ and $j$ which might be represented as a number in the 3 dimensional plane ? \nIf i look at the way the quaternions are constructed I think the answer is maybe, the reasoning I have for this is that given 2 imaginary numbers $i$ and $j$ we could construct it analogous and state that $$i^2=j^2=-1,$$ but what to do with the product $ij$? The product should square to one so it should be minus one or one:$$ij=-1\\quad\\text{ or }\\quad ij=1.$$If it squared to minus 1 it would be a new complex number, and then we would get that one of the numbers $i$ or $j$ is redundant (unless we itroduce a third one of course), so we continue with the demand that the second relation holds.</p>\n\n<p>Doesn't this give a valid way of constructing 3D-complex numbers ? Now for the quaternions itself you could argue the same and you could also choose that $ijk=+1$, is there a reason that the $-1$ is chosen (maybe this coincides with rotations in 3D ?)?</p>\n", "creation_date": 1397335374, "tags": ["complex-analysis", "complex-numbers", "quaternions"], "title": "Complex number with 3 dimensions"}, {"owner": {"reputation": 338}, "question_id": 751105, "body": "<p>Let $f: A \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$ and suppose for any $x,y \\in A , |f(x) - f(y)| \\leq M $</p>\n\n<p>Can we conclude that</p>\n\n<p>$$ \\sup_{x \\in A} f(x) - \\inf_{x \\in A} f(x) \\leq  M $$</p>\n", "creation_date": 1397335330, "tags": ["calculus"], "title": "basic question about inequalities and supremum and infimum"}, {"owner": {"reputation": 827}, "question_id": 751103, "body": "<p>When finding roots of complex functions we can write for example:</p>\n\n<p>$$z=2-2i$$</p>\n\n<p>Let's find complex numbers $w$ such that $$w^4 = 2-2i$$</p>\n\n<p>$$z = \\sqrt{8} e^{ \\frac{- \\pi }{4} i}$$</p>\n\n<p>This reads: square root of 8 times e to the minus pi over 4 times i (not sure why it's so unclear in the latex).</p>\n\n<p>Now $$w= 8^{1/8} e^{ - \\pi / 16 i}$$</p>\n\n<p>How come $i$ doesn't get affected by the power $1/4$?

For sake of a self-contained exposition, I will try to write here all the needed concepts.</p>\n\n<p>Let then $\\mathcal{V}=(\\mathcal{V}_{0},\\ \\otimes,\\ I,\\ a,\\ r,\\ l)$ be a monoidal category and let $\\mathcal{A}$ be an enriched $\\mathcal{V}-$category. Then one can define the <em>underling category</em> of $\\mathcal{A}$, denoted as $\\mathcal{A}_{0}$, whose objects are those of $\\mathcal{A}$ and whose hom-sets $\\mathcal{A}_{0}(A,B)$ are $\\mathcal{V}_{0}(I,\\ \\mathcal{A}(A,B))$, for $A,B$ objects of $\\mathcal{A}_{0}$. For $f\\in\\mathcal{A}_{0}(A,B)$ and $g\\in\\mathcal{A}_{0}(B,C)$, the composite $gf$ is given by the composite\n$$\nI\\overset{l^{-1}}{\\longrightarrow}I\\otimes I\\overset{g\\otimes f}{\\longrightarrow}\\mathcal{A}(B,C)\\otimes\\mathcal{A}(A,B)\\overset{M}{\\longrightarrow}\\mathcal{A}(A,C),\n$$\nwhere $M$ is the composition law in $\\mathcal{A}$.\nFurthermore, given a $\\mathcal{V}-$functor $T\\colon\\mathcal{A}\\to\\mathcal{B}$, the <em>underling functor</em> $T_{0}\\colon\\mathcal{A}_{0}\\to\\mathcal{B}_{0}$ acts as $T$ on the objects of $\\mathcal{A}_{0}$, while it sends $f\\in\\mathcal{A}_{0}(A,B)$ to $T_{AB}\\circ f$, where the composite is taken in $\\mathcal{V}_{0}$.</p>\n\n<p>Suppose now that $\\mathcal{V}$ is a closed, symmetric monoidal category and call the commutativity isomorphism $c$. Denote also with \n$$\n\\pi\\colon\\mathcal{V}_{0}(X\\otimes Y, Z)\\overset{\\simeq}{\\longrightarrow} \\mathcal{V}_{0}(X,[Y,Z])\n$$\nthe adjunction isomorphism. It is then possibile to see $\\mathcal{V}$ as a category enriched over itself (which we keep on calling $V$): the objects of $\\mathcal{V}$ are those of $\\mathcal{V}_{0}$, while the hom-object $\\mathcal{V}(X,Y)$ is $[X,Y]$. The composition law $M\\colon[Y,Z]\\times [X,Y]\\to [X,Z]$ is the arrow corresponding under $\\pi$ to the composite\n$$\n([Y,Z]\\times [X,Y])\\times X\\overset{a}{\\longrightarrow}[Y,Z]\\times ([X,Y]\\times X)\\overset{1\\otimes e}{\\longrightarrow} [Y,Z]\\times Y\\overset{e}{\\longrightarrow} Z\n$$\nThere is an isomorphism between the underlying category of $\\mathcal{V}$ as an enriched category over itself and $\\mathcal{V}_{0}$ which, as far as I understand,  should send a morphism $f\\colon A\\rightarrow B$ in the underlying category (so $f\\colon I\\rightarrow [A,B]$) to $\\pi^{-1}(f)\\circ l^{-1}$. Therefore, we can identify those two ordinary categories.</p>\n\n<p>We can also define a $\\mathcal{V}-$ functor $Ten\\colon \\mathcal{V\\otimes V}\\to\\mathcal{V}$. Here $\\mathcal{V}\\otimes\\mathcal{V}$ has object-class given by $\\mathcal{V}_{0}\\times\\mathcal{V}_{0}$ and $(\\mathcal{V}\\otimes\\mathcal{V})((X,Y),\\ (X',Y')):= [X,X']\\times [Y,Y']$. The $\\mathcal{V}-$functor $Ten$ sends an object $(X,Y)$ to $X\\otimes Y$, while $Ten_{(X,Y),(X',Y')}$ corresponds under $\\pi$ to the composite\n$$\n([X,X']\\otimes [Y,Y'])\\otimes (X\\otimes Y)\\overset{m}{\\longrightarrow} ([X,X']\\otimes X)\\otimes ([Y,Y']\\times Y)\\overset{e\\otimes e}{\\longrightarrow} X'\\otimes X.\n$$\nHere $m:(W\\otimes X)\\otimes (Y\\otimes Z)\\simeq (W\\otimes Y)\\otimes (X\\otimes Z)$ is the <em>middle-four interchange</em> isomorphism and $e\\colon [Y,Z]\\otimes Y\\longrightarrow Z$ is the evaluation morphism associated to $\\pi$ (the unit of the adjunction). One gets that $e(Ten\\otimes 1)=(e\\otimes e)m$. </p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Finally, here comes the question.</em></strong> It should be true that the ordinary functor $S$ given as the composite\n$$\n\\mathcal{V}_{0}\\times\\mathcal{V}_{0}\\longrightarrow (\\mathcal{V}\\otimes\\mathcal{V})_{0}\\overset{Ten_{0}}{\\longrightarrow}\\mathcal{V_{0}}\n$$\nis the tensor product $\\otimes\\colon\\mathcal{V}_{0}\\times\\mathcal{V}_{0}\\longrightarrow\\mathcal{V}_{0}$. <em>I can not prove this fact.</em> </p>\n\n<p>My attempt, up to now, has been the following. I have found that, on arrows $(f\\colon I\\rightarrow [A,A'],\\ g\\colon I\\rightarrow [B,B'])$, $S(f,g)$ corresponds, under $\\pi$, to $(e\\otimes e)\\circ m\\circ (((f\\otimes g)\\circ l^{-1})\\otimes 1)$. Under the identification between the underlying category of the $\\mathcal{V-}$ category $\\mathcal{V}$ and the ordinary category $\\mathcal{V_{0}}$, $S(f,g)$ should then be $(e\\otimes e)\\circ m\\circ (((f\\otimes g)\\circ l^{-1})\\otimes 1)\\circ l^{-1}$. Theorically speaking, it seems to me that I should then prove this last arrow to be the same as $\\otimes (f,g)$, which, under the above identification, should be $(\\pi^{-1}(f)\\circ l^{-1})\\otimes (\\pi^{-1}(g)\\circ l^{-1})$, but I can not do this.</p>\n\n<p>Any suggestion, as well as complete solutions to the problem, would be greately appreciated.</p>\n", "creation_date": 1397324176, "tags": ["category-theory", "monoidal-categories"], "title": "Underlying functor of tensor product in a closed and symmetric monoidal category."}, {"owner": {"reputation": 827}, "question_id": 750888, "body": "<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>\n\n<p>Find the extrema of the function $$f(x) = cos^2(x)$$ on the interval $ [-4,4]$</p>\n\n<p>I can differentiate and get $$f'(x) = -2 \\sin(x) \\cos(x)$$</p>\n\n<p>And set that to zero, but I'm pretty sure that's not entirely correct.</p>\n", "creation_date": 1397324112, "tags": ["calculus", "trigonometry", "optimization"], "title": "Find extrema on the interval"}, {"owner": {"reputation": 1}, "question_id": 750884, "body": "<p><br/>I'm trying to find solution to this problem:<br/>\nFor what pairs (a; b) of positive real numbers does the improper integral\n$$\n\\int_a^\\infty(\\sqrt{\\sqrt{x+a}-\\sqrt{x}}-\\sqrt{\\sqrt{x}-\\sqrt{x-b}})\\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nconverge?\n<br/>Any help will be appreciated.</p>\n", "creation_date": 1397324044, "tags": ["convergence", "improper-integrals"], "title": "Convergence of an improper integral(with parameters)"}, {"owner": {"reputation": 25}, "question_id": 750882, "body": "<p>Let $A=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\\\\n -4 &amp; -3 &amp; 1 \\\\\n k &amp; 0 &amp; 0\n\\end{bmatrix}$.

This is a lower bound because a) it doesn't include parentheses and b) it doesn't consider how the items are ordered and c) I think once you go to packages of size three, items may need to appear in the expression multiple times. </p>\n\n<p>So yes, I'm quite lost on how to incorporate all this stuff. </p>\n\n<p>Many thanks!</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:\nPerhaps this could be rephrased as \"How many distinct Boolean expressions can be made using N variables and the operators AND OR and XOR?\" I am not 100% those two questions are the same.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2:\nI think the answer is bound above by $2^{2^N}$ since that is the number of boolean functions on $N$ boolean variables. </p>\n", "creation_date": 1397322108, "tags": ["combinatorics", "logic", "combinations"], "title": "Combinatorial packages of N items [[How many distinct Boolean Expressions can be made using N variables]]"}, {"owner": {"reputation": 15}, "question_id": 750857, "body": "<p>I have the following problem</p>\n\n<p>Prove that if $X$ is a pointed cone then there exists a vector $c$ such that $c^Tx&gt;0$ for all nonzero $x \\in X$.</p>\n\n<p>For this, I seem to have a simple solution as follows:</p>\n\n<p>Suppose to the contrary that, $c^Tx \\le 0$ for every $c \\in \\mathbb R^n$ and for all nonzero $x \\in X$.

($\\mathrm B(X,Y)$ is the normed space of bounded linear operators from $X$ to $Y$, with as norm the operator norm).\nIt seems to me that this is not the case, and I have thought of (what I think is) a counterexample. I'm not completely sure about the last step I made and therefore would like to ask you to verify that it is correct, show me how to correct it, or tell me that my counterexample is wrong and why. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Claim</strong> If $X$ is a complete normed space and $Y$ a normed space, $\\mathrm B(X,Y)$ is not necessarily complete:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Proof</strong> Consider $X=\\ell^\\infty(\\N),Y=c_{00}(\\N)$ ($c_{00}(\\N)$ is the set of sequences of compact support), with the norm on $Y$ the $\\ell^1$ norm. Let, for $n\\in\\N_{\\geq 1}$, $T_n:X\\to Y$ be given by \n$$(x_1,x_2,x_3,\\ldots,x_n,x_{n+1},\\ldots)\\mapsto\\left(\\frac{x_1}{1^2},\\frac{x_2}{2^2},\\frac{x_3}{3^2},\\ldots,\\frac{x_n}{n^2},0,0,\\ldots\\right)$$\nFor every $n\\in \\N_{\\geq 1}$, $T_n$ is linear. Furthermore each $T_n$ is bounded: Let $x=(x_n)\\in X$. Then $\\|x\\|=\\sup|x_n|&lt;\\infty$. So \n$$\\|T_nx\\|=\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^n\\frac{|x_k|}{k^2}\\leq \\sum\\limits_{k=1}^n\\frac{\\sup|x_n|}{k^2}=\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^n\\frac{1}{k^2}\\|x\\|\\leq\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}\\|x\\|$$\nWe conclude that for all $n\\in\\N_{\\geq 1}, T_n\\in \\mathrm B(X,Y)$, because\n$$\\|T_n\\|\\leq \\frac{\\pi^2}{6}$$\nFurthermore $(T_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\\mathrm B(X,Y)$: Let $\\eps&gt;0$. $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{k^2}$ converges, so there is an $N\\in\\N$ such that $\\forall m,n\\geq N$ we have $\\sum_{k=m}^n \\frac{1}{k^2}=\\left|\\sum_{k=m}^n \\frac{1}{k^2}\\right|&lt;\\frac{\\eps}{2}$. Now let $x=(x_n)\\in X$. Then $\\|x\\|=\\sup |x_n|&lt;\\infty$ so for $m,n\\geq N$ (wlog we assume $m&lt;n$), we have\n$$\\|(T_n-T_m)x\\|=\\sum\\limits_{k=m+1}^n\\frac{|x_k|}{k^2}\\leq\\sum\\limits_{k=m+1}^n \\frac{\\sup|x_n|}{k^2}&lt;\\frac{\\eps}{2}\\|x\\|$$\nAnd from this it follows that for $m,n\\geq N$ \n$$\\|T_n-T_m\\|\\leq \\frac{\\eps}{2}&lt;\\eps$$\nFinally, $(T_n)$ does not converge: This is the step that I'm not completely sure about. My idea is as follows</p>\n\n<p>We have $\\mathrm B(X,\\ell^1(\\N))\\supset \\mathrm B(X,Y)$. $\\mathrm B(X,\\ell^1(\\N))$ is complete (because $\\ell^1(\\N)$ is complete) and $(T_n)$ is also a Cauchy sequence in $\\mathrm B(X,\\ell^1(\\N))$ and so it converges to a $T\\in \\mathrm B(X,\\ell^1(\\N))$. In fact we can give $T$ explicitly, for $x=(x_n)\\in\\ell^\\infty(\\N)$ we have $(Tx)_n=\\frac{x_n}{n^2}$ for each $n\\in\\N_{\\geq 1}$. Now it is clear that $T$ does not map $\\ell^\\infty(\\N)$ into $c_{00}(\\N)$ (consider the sequence with all entries equal to $1$ and what it gets mapped to) and so $T\\not\\in \\mathrm B(X,Y)$. If $(T_n)$ would converge in $\\mathrm B(X,Y)$ then it would converge to the same limit in $\\mathrm B(X,\\ell^1(\\N))$ (because we consider $\\mathrm B(X,Y)$ as a metric subspace of $\\mathrm B(X,\\ell^1(\\N))$) so by uniqueness of limits in $\\mathrm B(X,\\ell^1(\\N))$ we conclude that $(T_n)$ does not converge in $\\mathrm B(X,Y)$. </p>\n\n<p>This shows that $X$ being a complete normed space does not necessarily imply that $\\mathrm B(X,Y)$ is complete.</p>\n", "creation_date": 1397308021, "tags": ["functional-analysis", "normed-spaces"], "title": "$X$ complete normed space $\\implies\\mathrm B(X,Y)$ complete normed space?"}, {"owner": {"reputation": 8}, "question_id": 750648, "body": "<p>In numerical recipes in C, absolute value of complex number $a+ib$ is implemented as $b*\\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right)^2}$ if $|b|$ is greater than $|a|$ and $a*\\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right)^2}$ if $|a|$ is greater than $|b|$.

From this it follows that when $t = 0$ the velocity $v(t)$ will be equal to the initial velocity $u$; and at a certain point of time, the velocity $v(t)$ will be equal to zero. Do I need to differentiate the $v(t)=u-gt$ equation to get to the equation for the acceleration? And then integrate the acceleration equation twice? I am not even sure that $v(t)=u-gt$ is the right velocity equation. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks a lot!</p>\n", "creation_date": 1397223386, "tags": ["homework", "calculus", "physics"], "title": "Second order differential equation for acceleration"}, {"owner": {"reputation": 1}, "question_id": 749626, "body": "<p>Let $U$ be vector valued function:\n$$U=U(y_1,y_2,y_3)=U(U_1(y_1,y_2),U_2(y_1,y_2),U_3(y_1,y_2,y_3))$$ </p>\n\n<p>for $y_1=x_1, y_2=x_2, y_3=x_3g(x_1,x_2)$, where g is a smooth function. </p>\n\n<p>I want to find $\\Delta U$ in terms of $u(x_1,x_2,x_3)=U(y_1,y_2,y_3)$ but i find a long expression that is to say i am in doubt of my result. </p>\n\n<p>The result i want to find $$\\Delta U=\\Delta u+\\frac{1}{g}(\\nabla g \\cdot\\nabla)u$$ </p>\n\n<p>Thanks for your interest.</p>\n", "creation_date": 1397223216, "tags": ["multivariable-calculus"], "title": "Substitution - Laplacian"}, {"owner": {"reputation": 21}, "question_id": 749620, "body": "<p>How can one show there is no holomorphic function $f$ on the open unit disc $\\mathbb{D}$ such that it extends continuously to $\\frac{1}{z}$ on $\\partial\\mathbb{D}$?

I am just clearing my head here, feel free to ignore at your pleasure. In Linear Algebra, we learned that the dimension of a vector space is the number of vectors in its basis. This to me makes sense, since according to my understanding, the dimension of some space or some set with some <em>'structure'</em> on it (Sorry, don't know how to put this) is the number of independent <em>'parameters'</em> needed to specify each <em>'point'</em> in it. Does this same understanding of dimension carry over to say a topological space or some other type of space?

What is the dimension of say a sphere or a torus? What does it mean to say that a surface is a two-dimensional, topological manifold? Or is it just the case that we have defined it to be that way, meaning that we say a set $A$ is said to have dimension $n$ if such and such is true? Is there some basic underlying principles guiding these definitons? The following definiton also confuses me if I think about it too much</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Let $V$ be a vector space over an arbitrary \ufb01eld F. The projective space\n  $P(V)$ is the set of 1-dimensional vector subspaces of $V$ . If $dim(V ) = n + 1$, then the\n  dimension of the projective space is $ n.$</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In what sense does it have the dimension $n$?
