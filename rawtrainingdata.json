When the testing procedure, T, is applied to defective chips, T indicates \"bad\" 99.99% of the time, and the remaining 0.01% of the time, is a failure of the test to detect a defective chip.</p>\n\n<p>Let T denote the test result, and C the chip quality.

After listening to the lectures on Mathematical Physics by Carl Bender, I have fallen in love with asymptotic analysis.

And $y_\\text{sol}$ at large $x$ tends to a non-zero constant which I am interested in.</p>\n\n<p>I apply WKB.  But, before doing so I recognized this problem as arising from a 3-dimensional QM problem where $x$ is a radial coordinate.  I recalled some obscure claim by Langer (1937) that in order to get an 'accurate WKB result' we must rescale $x$ by putting $x=e^z$ to make the domain of the problem over the entire real numbers $-\\infty&lt;z&lt;\\infty$. [I have no understanding of why this must be done from an asymptotic analysis point of view; can someone help me with this?].

The end result (after transforming back to $u$ in $x$-space) is:</p>\n\n<p>$$\nu(x)\\sim A \\frac{1}{Q_L(x)^{1/4}}\\Big(e^{\\int_1^x dx' \\sqrt{Q_L(x')}}+B e^{-\\int_1^x dx' \\sqrt{Q_L(x')}}\\Big)\n$$\nHere, $Q_L = \\displaystyle\\frac{(n+1)^2}{4x^2}+\\frac{a^2 b^2\\,e^{-2x}}{x^{2n+1}}$ is slightly different from $Q$ due to the brief transformation to $z$-space, and $A$ and $B$ are constants fixed by boundary conditions. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Problems</strong></p>\n\n<p>When I plot this result against the numerically integrated solution for $u(x)$ and also for $y(x)$, I find that WKB does a fantastic job approximating the small $x$ behavior of the exact solution, but doesn't get quite get the large $x$ behavior correctly.  WKB <em>does</em> get leading the asymptotic behavior: $u'(x)/u(x) \\sim \\frac{n+2}{2}\\frac{1}{x}$ as $x\\rightarrow\\infty$.  But I need the next-to-leading asymptotic form which I expect to be $\\sim 1/x^{n+2}$. But WKB approximation tells me that it is $\\sim e^{-2x}$, which is very subdominant compared to what I am expecting.  I am puzzled by this because I thought WKB was supposed to uniformly get the right answer for all $x$!  I tried even tried taking the WKB approximation to next to leading order in hopes of getting the expected next-to-leading order asymptotic behavior, but I still keep getting highly subdominant terms...  what's going on??</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps I should follow a different strategy to determine the asymptotic behavior?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Plot</strong>\nHere is a plot of $y(x)$ satisfying $y(1)=1$ for $n=0$ and $a=100$, $b=1$:</p>\n\n<p>Magenta curve: numerically integrated.\nBlue curve: WKB result.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/4tB0a.png\" alt=\"plot\"></p>\n", "owner": {"reputation": 66}, "creation_date": 1396290707, "tags": ["differential-equations", "asymptotics", "self-learning"], "question_id": 734217}, {"title": "Difference between two independent geometric random variables", "body": "<p>Let $\\xi_1$ and $\\xi_2$ be independent random variables:\n$\\xi_1 \\simeq Geom(1/2), \\xi_2 \\simeq Geom(1/6)$.</p>\n\n<p>How do you find the probability mass function of $\\eta=\\xi_1-\\xi_2$ using convolution?</p>\n", "owner": {"reputation": 1}, "creation_date": 1396290660, "tags": ["probability", "convolution"], "question_id": 734216}, {"title": "using standard normal deviation to calculate mean?", "body": "<p>if i have an unknown mean, a standard deviation of 4, and P(X &lt; 8 ) = 0.3085, how do I calculate the mean <strong>somehow using the standard normal distribution and it's cummulative function?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I know that P(x&lt;8 ) = 0.3085 is the same as Phi((8 - mean)/4) = 0.3085, and now I want to isolate the mean.

To get a little grasp of this equation I tried to calculate solution in $\\mathbb{R}\\times [0,\\infty)$ with Fourier transform.\n\\begin{align}\n\\partial_{tt} u &amp;= - \\partial_{xx} u \\\\\nu(x,0) &amp;= f(x) \\\\\n\\partial_t u(x,0) &amp;= g(x)\n\\end{align}\nafter Fourier transform\n\\begin{align}\n\\partial_{tt} \\hat u &amp;= \\omega^2 \\hat u \\\\\n\\hat u(\\omega,0) &amp;= \\hat f(\\omega) \\\\\n\\partial_t \\hat u(\\omega,0) &amp;= \\hat g(\\omega)\n\\end{align}\nsolution is\n$$\n\\hat u(\\omega,t) = \\frac{\\sinh(\\omega t)}{\\omega} \\hat g(\\omega) + \\cosh(\\omega t) \\hat f(\\omega)\n$$\nThis gives quite crude restriction on $\\hat g, \\hat f$, they should decay faster than exponential. Than we can transform $\\hat u$ back and obtain solution. I guess when I work on $\\partial \\Omega \\times [0,1)$ for $\\Omega$ bounded than I would not encounter such integration problems so $f,g$ could be any continuous functions. I don't know how to proof that. </p>\n\n<p>The question is: Is my condition that $\\partial \\Omega$ is retract of $\\Omega^c$ sufficient condition for existence of solution? </p>\n", "owner": {"reputation": 1267}, "creation_date": 1396286931, "tags": ["functional-analysis", "pde"], "question_id": 734145}, {"title": "How to show that this function is measurable?", "body": "<p>$f$ is a monotone increasing real valued function defined on a interval.\nLet $g(x)=f(x)+x/n$   where $n$ is fixed natural number.\nProof $g$ is strictly increasing function and is measurable.</p>\n", "owner": {"reputation": 11}, "creation_date": 1396286804, "tags": ["analysis", "measure-theory", "lebesgue-measure"], "question_id": 734143}, {"title": "perturbation solution of two singular ODEs", "body": "<p>I need some help with solving the following system of ODEs:</p>\n\n<p>$$\\epsilon \\frac{dx}{dt}=Ay +ABx(1-y)$$ $$\\epsilon\\frac{dy}{dt}=Bx(1-y)-y-\\epsilon y$$</p>\n\n<p>I'm confused by the fact that both equation are singular so I get zeros for the coefficients of a simple perturbation expansion.

So I wrote up a diagram:</p>\n\n<p>$$\\require{AMScd} \\begin{CD} \\mathcal{V}(\\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(C,D) \\otimes \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(B,C) \\otimes \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,B),\\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,D)) @&lt;(1 \\otimes \\mu)^\\ast&lt;&lt; \\mathcal{V}(\\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(C,D)\\otimes \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,C),\\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,D)) \\\\\n @VVV @VVV \\\\ \n\\mathcal{V}(\\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(C,D) \\otimes \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(B,C) \\otimes \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,B) \\otimes A , D) @&lt;(1\\otimes\\mu \\otimes 1 )^\\ast &lt;&lt; \\mathcal{V}(\\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(C,D)\\otimes \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,C) \\otimes A,D)\\end{CD}$$</p>\n\n<p>where the vertical arrows are isos and got that the morphism $\\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(C,D) \\otimes ( \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(B,C)\\otimes \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,B) ) \\xrightarrow{1 \\otimes \\mu} \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(C,D) \\otimes \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,C) \\xrightarrow{\\mu} \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,D)$ is adjoint to the morphism\n$(ev^C_D(1 \\otimes ev^A_C))(1 \\otimes \\mu \\otimes 1).$ In the same way, I write up a diagram of the following form to see what \n $( \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(C,D) \\otimes  \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(B,C) )\\otimes \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,B)  \\xrightarrow{\\mu \\otimes 1} \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(B,D) \\otimes \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,B) \\xrightarrow{\\mu} \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,D)$ is adjoint to. The diagram is</p>\n\n<p>$$\\require{AMScd} \\begin{CD} \\mathcal{V}(\\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(C,D) \\otimes \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(B,C) \\otimes \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,B),\\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,D)) @&lt;(\\mu \\otimes 1)^\\ast&lt;&lt; \\mathcal{V}(\\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(B,D)\\otimes \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,B),\\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,D)) \\\\\n @VVV @VVV \\\\ \n\\mathcal{V}(\\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(C,D) \\otimes \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(B,C) \\otimes \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,B) \\otimes A , D) @&lt;(\\mu \\otimes 1 \\otimes 1 )^\\ast &lt;&lt; \\mathcal{V}(\\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(B,D)\\otimes \\underline{\\mathcal{V}}(A,B) \\otimes A,D)\\end{CD}$$\nso that the above composition is adjoint to $(ev^B_D(1 \\otimes ev^B_A))(\\mu \\otimes 1 \\otimes 1)$. So what we now want to show is that, actually:\n$$(ev^B_D(1 \\otimes ev^B_A))(\\mu \\otimes 1 \\otimes 1) = (ev^C_D(1 \\otimes ev^A_C))(1 \\otimes \\mu \\otimes 1).$$</p>\n\n<p>I am a bit unsure how to prove this to be honest - should I use some unit-counit to reduce it further?

If anyone could shed any light on finding these points and the values of $f$ at them, it would be much appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I've since discovered that the map is ramified at a point if and only if its derivative vanishes there. Using this, it's easy to determine that $-2^{-6}$ is the only $f_2$ value which gives $P(f_2)/f_2 = 0$ or $1728$ with non-vanishing derivative.</p>\n\n<p>As for $p=5$, the only values of $f_5$ for which $(1+250f_5+3125f_5^2)^3/f_f = 0$ or $1728$ and the derivative is nonzero are $f_5 = 5^{-3}(-11\\pm 2i)$, which has norm $5^{-3/2}$, as (sort of) conjectured.</p>\n", "owner": {"reputation": 1249}, "creation_date": 1396180823, "tags": ["algebraic-curves", "modular-forms"], "question_id": 732397}, {"title": "Valuation rings (confusion with arithmetics)", "body": "<p>I am reading Goldschmidt's Algebraic functions and projective curves.

If $p_i=p_j$ for all $i,j$, then $X$ would have a binomial Distribution. But the $p_i$ could be different. Thus we can say that $X$ has a Poisson-Binomial Distribution $PoissonBin(n,(p_1,...,p_n))$ with expected value $E[X]=\\sum_{i=1}^n p_i$ and variance $Var[X]=\\sum_{i=1}^n p_i (1-p_i)$.

This means that if I have a random variable distributed according to $Be(p_i)$ with $E[p_i]=p$ it is the same as to have a random variable distributed according to $Be(p)$? Is there any difference between $X_i$ and $\\tilde{X_i}$ where $\\tilde{X_i}$ has a $Be(p)$ Distribution? If yes, which and why - then my calculation from above would be wrong, wouldn't it? If not, how could that be intuitively?</p>\n\n<p>And if that is true, does it hold that then $X$ and $\\tilde{X}:=\\sum_{i=1}^n \\tilde{X_i}$ (thus $\\tilde{X}$ has a $Bin(n,p)$ Distribution) are the same, and thus $X$ is distributed according to $Bin(n,p)$?</p>\n\n<p>But then, the Poisson Binomial Distribution is only then needed if the $p_i$ are not identically distributed?</p>\n\n<p>Is it further important, that the $p_i$ are independent? Or would this work in any case? Which conditions are needed, such that $X$ has indeed a Binomial $Bin(n,p)$ Distribution?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you very much for your help, I'm a Little bit confused now..

Now its mathematically possible to isometrically embed this specific metric space in an Hilbert space. So I do it on this data to get a vector representation although its infinite dimensional, mathematically, I do it in alogorithmic approximation to get a finite dimensional vector representation, for each data element. In practicality this isometric embedding on real data is an approximate one. (I do it via clustering the data with defined metric).

This is the third time I've hosted this type of tournament. The first two times, we had 28 and 36 people play 7 rounds and I could not figure out a schedule that allowed for everyone to play with another play a maximum of one time. This time, we had 80 people play 8 rounds and I had no issue guaranteeing that everyone person was scheduled against others a maximum of one time. I'm considering altering the format for our next tournament and I want to know if there is a formula or algorithm that can be used to either:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Determine the maximum number of rounds (r) that can be scheduled to guarantee each person is only scheduled to play with another person a maximum of one time throughout the tournament, given p number of participants.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>OR</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Determine the minimum number of participants (p) that are needed to guarantee that each will be scheduled against another participant a maximum of one time, given r number of rounds.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The format of the tournament is: for each round, I schedule 4 people to a group. They play 3 games, one with each other group member as their partner. So, each participant plays against 3 other people in each round. Points are reported to me and the sum of points/wins is totaled to determine a ranking. There is no elimination. You can assume that the number of participants is a multiple of 4.</p>\n\n<p>The way that I've scheduled this, up to this point, is to put the names in a column in a spreadsheet and use a formula that based on the table number (t:1-20), seat number (s:1-4), a seed number for the round (r:1,4,5,7,9,11,13,17), and number of participants (p) that would pick a person from the list and put them into that seat. The basic formula is something along the lines of</p>\n\n<p>i = ((((t - 1) * 4) + (s - 1)) * r + 1) % p</p>\n\n<p>It also accounts for if p is divisible by r by adding 1 each loop through the list.

Assume that I am generating this lattice over a finite bounding volume (let's just make it a cube for simplicity and assume the set of planes exist within said cube).

I feel like I can probably solve this more easily by transforming every set of planes into a single plane that intersects the origin, finding the intersecting lines, then intersecting all of those lines and then generating the rest of the lattice since I know the spacing of vertices (if any) on each line will correspond to the distance along that line between the planes for each set (which is again known since the spacing is constant for each set) but this would still be inefficient for an arbitrary number of planes.

In probability, the concept of convolution makes perfect sense to me. If $t$ is a random variable with density $g(t)$ and $g(t) = f(x)h(y)$, then $P(T = t) = \\int f(\\tau)h(t-\\tau) d \\tau$. This is because the integral represents all the various ways that $x$ and $y$ can add to become the value $t$. A similar argument holds for the discrete case.</p>\n\n<p>But when I'm reading the various \"intros to signals and systems texts\", they describe a step by step process where you flip the h function over the y-axis, so that its  $h(-\\tau)$, add t, and then keep moving it over to the right step by step and calculating the area ( i.e.: the value of the integral at each time $\\tau$ )  by calculating the area covered by the overlapped values of $f$ and $h$. This doesn't make sense to me. In other words, is there some analog in signals and systems to the \"various ways that $x$ and $y$ can add to become the value $t$ in probability . Clearly, in the signals and systems framework, $t$ is not a random variable so the interpretation has to be totally different. But I'm wondering if there is some way of REALLY understanding why this is done. Maybe there is some physical reason due to what the function $h$ actually represents. They keep referring to it as the impulse response function so maybe my lack of understanding is because  I'm not understanding what the impulse response function really represents ?

If $f$ is a map $S^i \\to M$, then $f$ is homotopic to $\\tilde{f}$ which is transverse to $X$. If $i + (n-k) &lt; n$, this means that $X$ and the image of $\\tilde f$ are disjoint, so $[f] = [\\tilde f]$ is in the image of $\\iota^*_i$, so it is surjective. If $[f] = 1$, there is a map $g : D^{i+1} \\to M$ such that $g|_{\\partial D^{i+1}}= f$. But then if $i+1 + (n-k) &lt; n$, we have that $g$ is homotopic to $\\tilde g$ the image of which is disjoint from $X$. So if $\\iota^*_i$ maps a homotopy class to something null-homotopic in $M$, that homotopy class is actually null-homotopic in $M-X$, that is, the kernel of $\\iota^*_i$ is trivial, and we are done.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So my question is</strong>: is there a name for this result, which I imagine is well known, and is there a textbook reference for it?
